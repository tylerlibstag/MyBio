    <p>
        Hello, I graduated from Drexel University with a bachelor of Arts and Sciences.
        During my senior year I was the lead animator of my University senior project which consisted of 10 people on the team.   
        My skills revolve mostly around 3D modeling(textures, environments, characters), C#, 2D game development, Unity, and photoshop.  
        I love working with people, and believe that I am a strong contributing team member. I also like skateboarding,
        painting, and playing videogames
